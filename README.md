Challenge 2 Operations Complex developed with Windows Console Core 2.1

A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is a solution of the equation x² = -1. Because no real number satisfies this equation, i is called an imaginary number. For the complex number a + bi, a is called the real part, and b is called the imaginary part.

## Your Task

Design and implement a framework to represent complex numbers and to perform sums, subtractions, and multiplications between two complex numbers. If the programming framework of your choosing contains or there exists a library that already contains this data structure and/or functionality, **we ask you to forego its use**.
